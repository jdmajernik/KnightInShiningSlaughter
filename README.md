# Knight In Shining Slaughter
2018 Spring Project - Unity 2017.2

### Background
This was one of my first personal projects using Unity. I had messed with it before this point, but not with a specific goal in mind like how this project was structured.
While this was technically a school project, the constraints were intentionally vague to allow us to move in a direction that we wanted; therefore, I feel that it showcases part of my passion for games. 
The only big constraint was the 3-week time limit. That is why portions of this game are largely unfinished.

I worked by myself and I created all assets (sans the font).

### What I'm Proud of
1. I created a custom 2D platformer navigation system to allow for some rudimentary AI navigation
   - Included jump nodes and fall nodes for multi-platform navigation
2. I tried my hand at a more polished game experience including a camera system that was much more complex than any other I had developed up to this point.

### What I'd Change
1. The nav system was generated on load instead of in the editor, and it is horribly inefficient. So I would absolutely work more on that. The system is also fairly rudimentary and doesn't account for many variables, such as more complex platforming. Finally, it's super buggy, so I'd absolutely fix that.
2. Since I was still learning, my code is messy. I would try to clean it up much better for both readability and scalability.
3. Due to the nature of this game, a lot of assets were half-baked (to say the least), but the AI was particularly simple. I would have definately liked to have expanded on it to challenge the player more.

There are many, *many* more things I would have tweaked/added/bugfixed, but I'm proud of the results, given the time constraint (and my personal experience at the time)
