# Knight In Shining Slaughter
2018 Spring Project - Unity 2017.2

### Background
This was one of my first personal projects using Unity. I had messed with it before this, but not with a specific goal in mind like this was.
This was for a school project, but the constraints were intentionally vague to allow us to move in a direction that we wanted. The only big constraint was the 3-week time limit. That is why portions of this game are largely unfinished.
I worked by myself and I created all assets (sans the font).
### What I'm Proud of
1. I created a custom 2D platformer navigation system to allow for some rudimentary AI navigation
   - Included jump nodes and fall nodes for multi-platform navigation
2. I tried my hand at a more polished game experience including a more complex camera system than I'd ever used before
### What I'd Change
1. The nav system was generated on load instead of in the editor, and it is horribly inefficient. So I would absolutely work more on that. The system is also fairly rudimentary and doesn't account for many variables, such as more complex platforming. Finally, it's super buggy, so I'd absolutely fix that.
2. Since I was still learning, my code is messy. I would try to clean it up much better for both readability and scalability.
